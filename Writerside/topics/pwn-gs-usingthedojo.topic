        <chapter title="Configuring SSH" id="configuring-ssh">
            <p>On Windows I'll be using the
                <emphasis>ssh-agent</emphasis>
                . I had to configure the service to start manually:
            </p>
            <code-block lang="shell">
            Set-Service ssh-agent -StartupType Manual
        </code-block>
            <p>
                And then run:
            </p>
            <code-block lang="shell">
            Start-Service ssh-agent
        </code-block>
            <p>With the agent up and running I created an ssh key following the instructions provided on the website.
                Then
                I registered it on the agent using:</p>
            <code-block lang="shell">
            ssh-add LOCATION
        </code-block>

        <chapter title="Heads up for the Virtual Machine" id="heads-up-for-the-virtual-machine">
            <p>In later kernel-focused challenges it will be required to solve them in a virtual machine. The virtual
                machine can be interacted with using the <code>vm</code> command.</p>

    <chapter title="Challenges" id="challenges">
        <chapter title="Using the VSCode workspace" id="using-the-vscode-workspace">
            <p>
                Simple task solvable on the website. No notes needed as it only requires for the user to open up a new
                terminal window on VSCode.
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter title="Using the GUI desktop" id="using-the-gui-desktop">
            <p>
                Same case as the previous one. Simple task that does not require any writeup or explanation.
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter title="Pasting into the GUI desktop" id="pasting-into-the-gui-desktop">
            <p>
                This challenge tells the user how to manage the clipboard between the emulated desktop and the host PC
                as they have their own clipboard.
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter title="Restarting challenges" id="restarting-challenges">
            <p>
                This challenge teaches the user how to restart a particular challenge in case of need. For example if
                the user irreparably breaks the workflow of the challenge in their attempts of solving it. Just closing
                the workspace (in case of the GUI desktop) and pressing the start button again will do.
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter title="Getting help" id="getting-help">
            <p>
                This challenge gives the user a bunch of ways to get help. Like asking the discord, researching online,
                but the most important in this particular case is using the
                <control>SENSAI</control>
                LLM provided by
                the creators of the website.
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter title="Challenge programs" id="challenge-programs">
            <p>
                This is the first challenge that follows the kind of like the intended workflow of pwn.college.
                As it requires that the user interact with the
                <path>/challenge</path>
                directory, more generally: with the commandline interface of the provided workspace.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a fairly simple challenge, the only thing to do is run the specified file.
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter title="The flag file" id="the-flag-file">
            <p>
                This challenge serves as an introduction to the
                <path>/flag</path>
                file, the one that contains the flags
                as the name suggest. The real goal of any challenge is to somehow
                <emphasis>read</emphasis>
                the contents
                of this file.
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter title="Using practice mode" id="using-practice-mode">
            <p>
                This challenge serves as an introduction to the
                <control>practice mode</control>
                . An alternative mode on which the user has additional features (<code>sudo</code>) for debugging
                purposes.
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter title="Persistent home directory 1 and 2" id="persistent-home-directory">
            <p>
                This challenge tells the user about the persistence of the home directory, explaining that it's shared
                between different challenges, allowing the user to keep notes or references from previously solved ones.
